Things that I can improve is the-
    Tests should have better cases, i.e. cover more than just rendering
    Redux should be used to hold state instead of the parent app component
    Styling should be better.
    The facilities filter can be made more generic and handled at a lower level with redux.
    The sort functionality can be handled in another class outide app.js.
    Clean up the sorting predicates.
    Fetch the data from an endpoint instead of hard coding in the app.js file.
    Add prop types to ensure the corret types are used as said props.
    There are a few other things but the above are the main things to initially look at.
    
Sorry I checked in as one commit, I actually missed the incremental check-in part of submission details, please be
aware this is a practise I do professionally combined with feature branches and ensuring that master is always deployable.

If you have any questions please just ask.
